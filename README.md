## Installation

You need to have [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed.
```
  git clone git@github.com:sudodoki/gitter-data.git gitter-data
```

## Usage

You will need to pass `gitter-token` via environment variable. You can find one under [Personal Access Token](https://developer.gitter.im/apps) section. You have 2 options to pass it to the app:
  1. copy `profiles.clj.example` to `profiles.clj` and put a proper gitter token in
  2. pass it from command line. For me it would be something like `env gitter-token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX lein run`
  
To run app just execute `lein run`


## Options

No options.
